# Carrier JS

> Carrier JS is a **caching** based HTTP client for browsers. It has the ability to store copies of frequently accessed data in several places along the request-response path. It deliver cached responses for common requests and helps to access data  quickly and inexpensively.

## Why CarrierJs

Duplicate API requests are common and if dealt wisely, can help developers in creating a seamless user experience. In a scalable application, duplicate API requests can be problematic to the resources on a server, can affect the cost, and can interrupt performance.

That is why it is important to pay attention to API calls and ensure that no duplicate request is passed to the API server.

**Possible Reasons for duplicate API requests -**

There can be different scenarios where an API is called multiple times to get the data. For example,

- When a user taps on a button multiple times before it gets disabled.

- At times, one API response causes another API request to execute. Let‚Äôs understand this with an analogy. There are several books with the same author details. As the details of the book get loaded, another requests to load the author's details is passed consequently. In this scenario, the request for multiple book details can hit the author's details API (while one is already under execution).

- API requests on scroll events can hit an API multiple times as the scroll event triggers rapidly.

To prevent from the duplicate API requests, **CarrierJs** comes into the picture üëá.

## How it works internally

First, it checks to see whether data exists in the cache. If it exists, it returns data from the cache as a response. If it doesn't exist then it read data from the API server.

Then it writes to the cache and returns the data as response. The subsequent requests will be served through the cache.

If you want fresh data everytime from the API server, you can pass an extra parameter called `refresh` with value `true` after the API server url.

This diagram shows how carrierjs internally fulfills the request with its ultimate caching feature.

## Benefits

There are several benefits of caching your API‚Äôs response. Here are some of them:

- Your quality of service improves.
- The website consumes less bandwidth.
- The website latency decreases.
- Server load also decreases.

## Features

- Make **XMLHttpRequest** from browser
- Supports **All Browsers**
- Enable IndexedDB Based Caching which can store **250MB** of data
- Data will not expire unless explicit deletion of the database **(persistent storage)**
- It decreases server round trips for fetching data from the database by persisting data in the memory.

## Examples

**Performing a GET request:**

```jsx

// Using Promise
carrier.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/').then((result) => {
    console.log(result)
}).catch((err) => {
    console.log(err)
});

---------

// Using Async/Await
async function getUser() {
  try {
    const response = await carrier.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/')
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

**Performing a POST request:**

```jsx
const data = {
	title: "delectus aut autem",
	completed: false
}

// Using Promise
carrier.post('/todos', data).then((result) => {
    console.log(result)
}).catch((err) => {
    console.log(err)
});

---------

// Using Async/Await
async function createUser(data) {
  try {
    const response = await carrier.post('/todos', data)
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

createUser(data);
```

**Performing a PUT request:**

```jsx
const data = {
	title: "delectus aut autem",
	completed: false
}

// Using Promise
carrier.put('/todos', data).then((result) => {
    console.log(result)
}).catch((err) => {
    console.log(err)
});

---------

// Using Async/Await
async function createUser(data) {
  try {
    const response = await carrier.put('/todos', data)
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

createUser(data);
```

## Request method aliases

For your ease, aliases have been provided for request methods.

**carrier.get(url, [refresh])**

**carrier.post(url, [data])**

**carrier.put(url, [data])**

**carrier.delete(url, [data])**

**Note -** While using this methods, `url` is required and `data` is optional. `refresh` is by default `false`. If you want to get fresh data everytime from the server, you need to send `true` after `url` parameter.

## Response Object

The response for a request contains the following information.

```js
{
  // `response` is the response that was provided by the server
  response: {},

  // `status` is the HTTP status code from the server response
  status: 200,

  // `type` is the type of response recieved from the server eg. json, script
  type: '',

  // `headers` the HTTP headers that the server responded with headers
  headers: {},

  // `config` is the config that was provided to `carrierjs` for the request
  config: {},

  // `request` is the request that generated this response
  request: {}

  // `url` is the url to that request is generated
  url: {}
}
```
